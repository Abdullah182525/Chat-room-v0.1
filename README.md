<h1>Welcome to Chat Room project v0.1</h1>
<h2>i've made this to help people who doesnt know how to make chat projects</h2>
<h2>you can learn from this to achieve your desired app</h2>

<h1>Explanation:</h1>
<h2>the main idea is Rooms, rooms where people can enter with a name, once they join they can send and recieve messages</h2>
<h2>the way it works is like: every room has a roomId if someone enters the roomid they can enter the desired room, every user that enters the room has a userid , when someone enters the room id and name they will retrieve an authorization code , that authorizatin code must be provided to enter the room, once they enter the room (url) they will request a session id from the server using the authorization id, once they get the sessionid they will request to a messages web socket with the session id that they use to send or recieve new messages.</h2>
